🌦️ Dynamic Weather Application | Real-Time Weather Updates 🌍

I’m excited to share my latest project—a Weather Application that provides real-time weather updates for any city! This project was an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my web development skills by working with APIs and building an interactive, user-friendly interface. 🚀

Key Features:
  ✅ Real-Time Weather Updates: Enter the name of any city to get instant weather details.
  ✅ Displays Key Weather Data: Temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
  ✅ Dynamic Weather Icons: Automatically changes icons based on weather conditions like clouds, rain, clear sky, snow, drizzle, and mist.
  ✅ Error Handling: Displays an error message for invalid or unrecognized city names.
  ✅ Clean & Responsive UI: Designed to work seamlessly across devices.

  💡 This project helped me strengthen my understanding of API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (async/await), and error handling, while also improving my UI/UX design skills. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating this app and seeing it come to life!
